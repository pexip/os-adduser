adduser (3.130) unstable; urgency=low

  deluser's --no-preserve-root option is deprecated, and it will be
  removed after Debian bookworm. deluser will in the future completely
  refuse to delete the root user. If you want to delete root, you need
  to use other tools.

  We are planning to deprecate and remove the GROUPHOMES and LETTERHOMES
  configuration options. They help big installations, but nowadays those
  installations are probably using a directory service like LDAP and Active
  Directory to manage their users and do not use adduser anyway. If you're
  using one of these options and want them to stay, please write that to
  #1025623 and let us know. Some kind of help and committment, for example
  verified autopkgtest scripts, would be appreciated and make it easier for
  us to keep the feature around.

  We are planning to deprecate and remove the QUOTAUSER configuration
  option. If you're using this, please write that to #1026898 and let us
  know. Some kind of help and committment, for example verified autopkg
  testscripts, would be appreciated and make it easier for us to keep
  the feature around.

  There have been some changes to --disabled-password and --disabled-login,
  documented in adduser(8). Maintainers using these options with adduser
  --system in their maintainer scripts should review their scripts and
  check whether the default is enough and the options can be removed.

  The --gecos option is being renamed to --comment to get aligned with
  passwd's terminology. --gecos will continue to work throughout the
  bookworm cycle.

  The NEWS entry for 3.124, shown below, was added to give more explanation
  about the addition of the users group as a supplementary group to a newly
  created user. This change was inconsistently documented in adduser(8),
  this inconsistency was fixed in adduser 3.130.

adduser (3.124) unstable; urgency=medium

  As pointed out in #678615, adduser has behaved somewhat inconsistently
  in the past, using the users group (GID 100) only if USERGROUPS was set
  to the non-default 'no'. This has been changed as documented in
  adduser.conf(5): If USERGROUPS is yes, the newly created user will now
  be added as a supplementary group; if USERGROUPS is no, users will be the
  primary group. If you want to restore the old behavior, set USERGROUPS=yes,
  leave USERS_GROUP empty and set USERS_GID to "-1".

  (this NEWS entry has been added retroactively with adduser 3.130)

adduser (3.123) unstable; urgency=medium

  The default for DIR_MODE has been set to 0700 for this release, again,
  after adduser 3.122 had DIR_MODE set to 2700. Previous versions of
  adduser defaulted to 0700 for the majority of this century. The default
  for SYS_DIR_MODE is still 0755.

  Note that the default for DIR_MODE is a change from historical defaults,
  which were more permissive for normal user home directories.
  Adjustments may need to be made for setups like public_html
  web content, or in-homedir mail configurations.

  System Administrators wanting a different default can set DIR_MODE
  in /etc/adduser.conf to their desired value after installation.
  The one user created during system installation needs to have the
  home directory mode bits adjusted to the preferred value after
  installation of the system since there is no possibility to have this
  directly set in the Installer.

  See /usr/share/doc/adduser/README.Debian for detailed reasoning.

adduser (3.122) unstable; urgency=low

  This version implements SYS_DIR_MODE for home directories belonging
  to system users. Before that, the home directory of a system user was
  also influenced by the setting of DIR_MODE. This is no longer the case.

  --add_extra_groups is now --add-extra-groups. The old spelling
  is still possible and will remain supported during Debian bookworm,
  allowing package maintainers and local users to slowly migrate during
  the bookworm cycle.

  --force-badname is now --allow-badname. The old spelling is still
  possible and will remain supported during Debian bookworm, allowing
  package maintainers and local users to slowly migrate during the
  bookworm cycle.

  System user home defaults to /nonexistent if --home is not specified.
  Packages that call adduser to create system accounts should explicitly
  specify a location for /home (see Lintian check
  maintainer-script-lacks-home-in-adduser).
