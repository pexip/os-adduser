.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdeluser\fP and \fBdelgroup\fP remove users and groups
from the system according to command line options
and configuration information in
\fI/etc/deluser.conf\fP and \fI/etc/adduser.conf\fP.
.PP
They are friendlier front ends to the
\fBuserdel\fP and \fBgroupdel\fP programs,
removing the home directory as option
or even all files on the system owned by the user to be removed,
running a custom script,
and other features.
.PP
For a full list and explanations of all options,
see the OPTIONS section.
.PP
\fBdeluser\fP and \fBdelgroup\fP can be run in one of three modes:

.SS "Remove a user"
If called with one non-option argument and
without the \fB\-\-group\fP option,
\fBdeluser\fP will remove a non-system user.
.PP
By default,
\fBdeluser\fP will remove the user
without removing the home directory,
the mail spool or
any other files on the system owned by the user.
Removing the home directory and mail spool
can be achieved using the \fB\-\-remove\-home\fP option.
.PP
The  \fB\-\-remove\-all\-files\fP option
removes all files on the system owned by the user.
Note that if you activate both options
\fB\-\-remove\-home\fP will have no additional effect
because all files including
the home directory and mail spool
are already covered by the \fB\-\-remove\-all\-files\fP option.
.PP
If you want to backup all files before deleting them
you can activate the \fB\-\-backup\fP option
which will create a file \fIusername.tar(.gz|.bz2)\fP
in the directory specified by the \fB\-\-backup\-to\fP option.
.PP
By default,
the backup archive is compressed with \fBgzip\fP(1).
To change this,
the \fB\-\-backup\-suffix\fP option can be set
to any suffix supported by \fBtar \-\-auto\-compress\fP (e.g. .gz, .bz2, .xz).
.PP
\fBdeluser\fP will refuse to remove the root account.
.PP
If the \fB\-\-system\fP option is given on the command line, the
delete operation is actually executed only if the user is a system user.
This avoids accidentally deleting non-system users.
Additionally,
if the user does not exist,
no error value is returned.
Debian package maintainer scripts
may use this flag
to remove system users or groups
while ignoring the case where the removal already occurred.

.SS "Remove a group"
If \fBdeluser\fP is called with the \fB\-\-group\fP  option,
or \fBdelgroup\fP is called,
a group will be removed.
The primary group of an existing user cannot be removed.
If the option \fB\-\-only\-if\-empty\fP is given,
the group won't be removed if it has any members left.
.PP
The \fB\-\-system\fP option adds the same functionality as for users,
respectively.

.SS "Remove a user from a specific group"
If called with two non-option arguments,
\fBdeluser\fP will remove a user from a specific group.

.SH OPTIONS
Different modes of \fBdeluser\fP allow different options.
If no valid modes are listed for a option,
it is accepted in all modes.
.PP
Short versions for certain options may exist for historical reasons.
They are going to stay supported, but are removed from the documentation.
Users are advised to migrate to the long version of options.
.TP
.B \-\-backup
Backup all files contained in the userhome and the mailspool file
to a file named \fIusername.tar.bz2\fP or \fIusername.tar.gz\fP.
Valid Modes: \fBdeluser\fP, \fBdeluser \-\-system\fP,

.BI "\-\-backup\-to "dir
Place the backup files not in the current directory but in \fIdir\fP.
This implicitly sets \fB\-\-backup\fP also.
(defaulting to the current working directory).
Valid Modes: \fBdeluser\fP, \fBdeluser \-\-system\fP,
.TP
.BR "\-\-conf \fIfile\fP"

.SH SECURITY
\fBdeluser\fP needs root privileges and offers,
via the \fB\-\-conf\fP command line option
to use different configuration files.
Do not use \fBsudo\fP(8) or similar tools to
give partial privileges to \fBdeluser\fP
with restricted command line parameters.
This is easy to circumvent and might
allow users to create arbitrary accounts.
If you want this,
consider writing your own wrapper script
and giving privileges to execute that script.

.SH FILES
.IR /etc/deluser.conf
